Despite three years since our club's launch, many people are still unaware of our activities, purpose, and significance within our community. Hence, I have decided to write this piece to share about our club and my journey as a founder, member, committee member, and leader.

# I never heard of APUBCC, what's that?

Asia Pacific University Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Club (APUBCC), founded in 2021, has rapidly evolved into a vibrant hub for student blockchain enthusiasts and innovators. With over 600 members, 30+ partners, and a track record of hosting 30+ events, APUBCC provides a central hub for learning, sharing, and creating in the blockchain and cryptocurrencies space.

Our mission is always clear: **to be the leading student hub for Web3 talent**, **fostering skills and creativity** to advance blockchain both locally and globally. 

Guided by a dedicated committee of 30+ members, the club has nurtured notable Web3 contributors like:

# 3 years of journey, GMI or NGMI?

Our club's journey began in 2021, and I was privileged to be among its founding members. In those “good old days”, I took on the responsibility of establishing our digital footprint, which involved setting up our official email, creating and managing our social media accounts, and building our online community platforms, including our Discord server and WhatsApp group. These initial steps were pretty much important for our club's growth and engagement with the members.

A significant milestone in our club's history was our **FIRST** event, which took place on **August 17, 2021** – exactly three years ago from today. The event featured a talk on "Blockchain and Money" by Mr. Suresh, marking our first foray into public education and discussion on blockchain technology. 

<div class="flex justify-center">

</div>

**Fun fact even though no one asked**: 
> At the time of this event, the Bitcoin price stood at $44,534, and we were just emerging from a minor bear market. 

This actually added an interesting angle to our daily discussions and demonstrated how rapidly the cryptocurrency world can change, as most of us were crypto traders during that time.

## Our Focus Throughout 3 Years

Continuing from the previous discussion, it is worth mentioning our club's focus and what I have learned throughout this three-year journey. During this time, I have worked under three different presidents, each bringing their unique vision to the club.

Our club's focus has evolved significantly over the years, reflecting the unique vision and leadership style of each president. 

Here’s an overview of how our priorities have shifted under each president:

- **First President (August 2021 - June 2022)** <br>
During the first presidency, from August 2021 to June 2022, our club primarily focused on trading, cryptocurrency, and event organization. <br> <br> The composition of our committee reflected this emphasis, with most members coming from business backgrounds and a smaller group from computing. Many members joined the club hoping to gain knowledge about cryptocurrency investments. This initial interest in potential financial gains shaped our early event planning.<br> <br> However, this narrow focus didn't come without its challenges. We frequently received feedback and complaints about the nature of our events, suggesting a disconnect between our offerings and the broader interests of the student body. Even though we faced challenges and had different ideas about what events to organize, we didn't give up. Our team worked hard to offer a variety of events, trying to find a balance between our members' interest in trading and other important blockchain topics such as NFTs, Game-Fi and etc. In fact, this period was important in building practical market knowledge and fostering strong community engagement. <br> <br> As a core committee of the team, I took on responsibilities in community building and marketing. During the time, I also took the initiatives to host informal discussion ranging different topics including blockchain fundamentals, NFTs, P2E and etc. <br> <br> This experience significantly improved my soft skills, particularly my English speaking ability. It also enhanced my research skills and gave me a deep understanding of how to nurture and grow a vibrant blockchain community. <br> <br>

- **Second President (July 2022 - August 2023)** <br>
From July 2022 to August 2023, our group underwent significant changes, shifting our focus towards a deeper understanding of blockchain technology and improved organizational development. We concentrated on grasping blockchain fundamentals, conducting project research, and enhancing our team's skills. During this period, I stepped into more prominent leadership roles, particularly in research, and took charge of organizing events and facilitating group discussions. <br> <br> Our main goals remained consistent throughout this time. We aimed to **provide opportunities for our team members, including internships, jobs, and ambassador roles**. We also focused on **increasing knowledge across the group** and **creating an environment where people could learn and develop their skills**. <br> <br> This experience was crucial for my personal growth. It significantly improved my research abilities, communication skills, and leadership capabilities. Moreover, it taught me valuable lessons about guiding a team and managing complex projects in the blockchain space. These newly acquired skills and insights have proven to be incredibly valuable in my professional development. <br> <br>

- **Third President (September 2023 - September 2024)** <br>
As my tenure as research lead came to an end, our president recognized my potential in external relations and public relations. Consequently, I was reassigned to manage our partnerships and external connections, a role that had become increasingly important for our club's growth. <br> <br> Working alongside Kai Min, we successfully secured substantial funding for various club activities, including events, hackathons, and workshops. Our efforts in applying for grants and seeking opportunities played a crucial role in ensuring the club's financial sustainability. <br> <br> Our president, a technology enthusiast with a strong background in hackathons, brought a unique perspective to the club. His experience ranged from Web 2 to Web 3 technologies, and he was known as "Eth Maxi" before turning into "Chain Fxxkboy" after realising the importance to be chain-agnostic. This background significantly influenced the club's direction. <br> <br> Under his leadership, the club's focus shifted towards more practical, hands-on activities. We began prioritizing project development, hosting technology-related bootcamps, and organizing hackathons. The president strongly encouraged all committee members to participate in hackathons, regardless of their technical background.<br> <br> This new direction marked a significant change from our previous emphasis on building foundational knowledge in cryptocurrency. Instead, we started concentrating on practical skill development and expanding our technical expertise. While this approach offered valuable hands-on experience, it represented a departure from our earlier focus on comprehensive crypto education. <br> <br> Taking on the external relations role significantly boosted my personal and professional growth. I developed crucial skills in communication, networking, and strategic partnership building. This experience taught me to engage effectively with diverse partners, create mutually beneficial arrangements, and represent our club professionally. I learned to tailor my communication style, negotiate partnerships, and think creatively to align our goals with external parties. These skills have proven invaluable, contributing to both the club's success and my own ongoing personal development.

## Challenges that we faced

APUBCC is still a young club, started only three years ago. Like any new group, we are still figuring things out and facing the usual challenges that come with getting started. We are learning as we go, dealing with different problems, and working on becoming stronger and more flexible as a team.

One of our primary hurdles has been **the development of a healthy organizational culture**. This including:
- **Unhealthy team culture**
We have had some toxic behavior, including gossip among team members. This hurts our ability to work together and solve problems. Instead of talking things out directly, some people spread rumors and talking bad about others behind which damages trust in our team.
- **Leadership and task distribution issues**
Leaders, including myself, often do tasks alone instead of sharing the work. We might think this is faster or ensures better quality, but it causes problems. Some team members end up with nothing to do, making them feel left out or unimportant.

We also **face significant challenges in retaining committee members and contributors**:

- **Perceived lack of value and long term vision**
    
    Many committees leave or lose interest in our club due to unclear benefits. While some join for immediate perks like free swags or event access, this misses the club's true value. A few ex-committees commented lack of values in the club, but I always see it differently:
    
    - The club offers unique opportunities compared to others at APU
    - True value comes from both contributing to and benefiting from the club
    - Career advancement is a key long-term benefit, which is why I have stayed involved for three years

    Instead of seeking constant external rewards, committees should:
    
    - Provide value by taking on roles like speaker, moderator, or emcee
    - Use the club to develop soft skills
    - Focus on personal and professional growth
    
    Many lose interest because they fail to recognize these less tangible but more significant benefits. The club's value lies in the opportunities it provides for skill development and career advancement, not just in immediate material rewards. <br><br>
- **Stress from frequent events**
    We reached a point where our club was organizing an excessive number of events without clear outcomes or benefits for our committees. This approach led to overwhelming stress and exhaustion among committee members, with a focus on quantity over quality in our events. We neglected the needs and growth of our organizing team in the process. Moving forward, we should prioritize quality events over sheer quantity, ensuring each event has clear benefits for both attendees and organizers. We also need to be more selective with our partnerships and event choices. As part of leadership team, I will take responsibility for overlooking this issue and am committed to addressing it. <br><br>
- **Competing priorities**
    Many committee members resigned to focus on their Final Year Projects (FYP), highlighting the natural priority shift as students approach graduation. This underscores our need to better balance club activities with academic responsibilities. My personal approach was to prioritize club involvement, seeing greater long-term benefits, while still maintaining strong academic performance. Going forward, we should create more flexible roles for final-year students, explore ways to integrate club activities with academic projects, and highlight how club experiences can complement academic work. This balance can help us retain experienced members while respecting their academic commitments.

Additionally, we are struggling with **community building**

- **Low Engagement**
    
    Our club faces a serious challenge with low member participation, indicating a mismatch between our offerings and members' interests. Despite having a member database, we have failed to understand what our members truly want. This lack of engagement significantly hampers our club's success.<br>
    
    To address this, we need to:
    
    - Encourage more active participation from committees in events
    - Ensure members gain real benefits and experiences from their involvement
    - Conduct a survey to better understand member interests and needs
    - Align our activities with member preferences
    
    By focusing on these areas, we can increase engagement and create more relevant, valuable experiences for our members. This approach will be crucial for the club's future success and growth. Increased participation from everyone will lead to a stronger, more vibrant club community. <br><br>

- **Lack of committee-led initiatives**
    Few committees take the initiative to organize community events like informal discussions, Twitter AMAs, or educational series. While we have had some success with informal discussions, we need more committees/members actively sharing knowledge with club members, rather than gatekeeping information.  <br><br>
- **Inconsistent event organization**
    Our inability to maintain regular events affects our club's reliability and member engagement. Successful Web3 communities, like Superteam, demonstrate that consistency is key in running a thriving community. Regular, periodic events help maintain member interest and participation.  <br><br>
- **Limited appeal to non-technical students**
    
    Our club's shift towards more technical events, driven by leadership preferences, has led to limited appeal for non-technical students. This narrow focus means we are missing out on diverse perspectives and talents. To address this, we should:
    
    - Diversify our event types to include more business, creative, and soft skill-focused activities
    - Balance technical events with non-technical offerings to cater to a broader audience
    - Encourage a mix of both technical and non-technical committee-led initiatives

These problems make it hard for our club to grow and keep members involved. We need to fix these issues to create a better environment where everyone works together, feels included, and can contribute effectively. This is crucial for the health and success of our club.

We collaborate with vibrant communities like ETHKL and Superteam Malaysia, as well as established protocols such as Arbitrum, Starknet, Solana, and Aptos. As our president is trying to be “chain-agnostic”, these different partnerships enable us to organize diverse events that cover various aspects of blockchain technology but not just on a “particular chain”. Our collaborations serve two main purposes which are enhancing member learning through industry insights and creating job opportunities by connecting skilled members with potential employers. By bridging academia and industry, APUBCC plays a key role in shaping the future blockchain workforce. Our extensive network has positioned us as a central hub in the blockchain ecosystem, facilitating knowledge exchange and driving talent growth in the region.

### **APUBCC Discord Server**
To foster a sense of community and facilitate ongoing discussions, I established and managed APUBCC's Discord server. This digital space has become a hub of activity, with carefully organized channels covering various blockchain topics and interests. By actively moderating and encouraging engagement, I have helped to create a vibrant online community where members can network, share knowledge, and stay connected beyond our physical events.

### **Hosted 10+ Discussions + Twitter Space + IRL Events**
I have been actively involved in organizing and hosting various APUBCC events. This includes moderating over 10 blockchain discussions, running Twitter Spaces, and coordinating in-person meetups.

### **Additional Contributions**
I also enhanced our club's research initiatives by producing informative articles. These showcased our expertise and provided valuable resources for members and the wider blockchain community. While my contributions to APUBCC have been extensive, these highlights represent my core impact areas, and I don't want to add any more because it is almost a 15-minute read for this piece. This concise overview captures my primary contributions to APUBCC's growth and success, even though I often mentioned I did nothing in APUBCC.


# Closing Thoughts

> These three years have been a testament to the power of collective effort and shared vision. Without each of you, this journey would not have been as meaningful, impactful, or successful as it has been.

Before I conclude this piece, I would like to share my thoughts on various aspects.

As students, we should maximize our university experience beyond just attending classes and completing assignments. To truly thrive:

- Actively join and contribute to clubs like APUBCC
- Network and meet new people through various events
