            <div class="font-normal text-xl py-6">
                <p class="text-gray-500"> I have a passion for programming, content creation, and research. During my free time, I engage in research and create content for my Instagram account, benefiting both myself and others. Python and Javascript are my favorite programming languages. Python is easy to learn, and I particularly enjoy web development. I am eager to delve into JavaScript and Rust as they play a vital role in building Web 3 products. Fluent in English, Malay, and Chinese, I am especially proficient in Chinese, my mother tongue.</p>
                <p class="py-6 text-gray-500"> As a relentless learner, I constantly seek opportunities to enhance and diversify my skill set by taking on new and challenging tasks. While I thrive in team environments, I am equally adept at working independently. I am highly enthusiastic about Blockchain, Web 3, NFTs, and cryptocurrencies, as I believe they hold immense potential as future technologies. </p>
